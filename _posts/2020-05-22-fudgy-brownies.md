Incredibly rich, indulgent and gooey brownies! 

<i><u>Ingredients</u></i>
- Chocolate (225g)
- 12 tablespoons butter (melted)
- 1 ¼ cups demerara sugar (250g)
- 2 eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (95g)
- 1/4 cup cocoa powder (30g)
- 1 Teaspoon Salt


<i><u>Method</u></i>
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Line baking dish with parchment paper.
2. Chop the chocolate into smaller pieces. Melt half of the chocolate saving the other half for later.
3. In a large bowl, mix the butter and sugar with an electric hand mixer, then beat in the eggs and vanilla beat until the mixture becomes fluffy and light in colour.
4. Whisk in the melted chocolate (make sure it's not too hot or else the eggs will cook), then sift in the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Gently fold to mix in the dry ingredients, stop once all the ingredients are incorporated. Finally add in the remaining chocolate chunks. Note, over mixing the mix will cause the brownies to come out more cake like consistency.
5. Bake for 20-25 minutes, depending on how fudgy you like your brownies, check the consistency with a skewer in the centre to ensure its not raw. Then leave to cool completely.
