1. Preheat your oven to 220Â°C.
2. Cut your potatoes into small desired size, i went for roughly 1 inch pieces. Coat in oil, salt, pepper and put them into the oven.
3. Chop up some bacon into small pieces and fry in a non-stick pan, remove from the pan once cooked, leaving the fat in the pan, and save it for later.
4. Now chop off the ends of the asparagus and cook in the bacon fat, these can be placed in the oven wrapped in tin foil to keep warm.
5. Now on the largest ring of your hob, preheat a non-stick pan on medium - low.
6. Season the skin side of the fish with salt and a little bit of oil. Place the fish into the pan, skin side down and leave until you get beautiful crispy skin. Once crispy flip the fish to finish cooking.
