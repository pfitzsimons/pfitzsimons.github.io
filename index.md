<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Welcome to my website, where I will be posting about my experiences travelling and recipes of food that I've cooked.</p>

<p>I'm a Software Engineer with a young family and while both of these things keep me very busy nothing can take 
me away from my passion of food. The original idea for this blog came from constantly being asked 'What are you having 
today?' for lunch, as I always try to bring in something homemade (<i>usually leftovers!</i>).</p>
